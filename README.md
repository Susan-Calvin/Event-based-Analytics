|Event based marketing analysis|Final project of second module|Data Analysis of the sales funnel, event funnel, and results of an A/A/B experiment on changing the font in a mobile food products app|python, pandas, datetime, numpy, scipy, math, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly|
# Description:
We work at a startup that sells food products. We need to investigate user behavior for the company's app. There are two major tasks in this research:
1. To study the funnel and sequence of events
2. To make conclusion on A/AB testing - the designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating.
